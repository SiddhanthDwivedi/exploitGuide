I have started this blog to share some of the knowledge,techniques, vulnerabilities, etc, that I come accross. This is my humble attempt to give back to the community. It also forces me to finally structure my thoughts, cheatsheets and notes. So why not share them if they can profit you too!

I started using the computer at a tender age of 7 .and from then I have evolved my skills drastically, a tech enthusiast, Cybersecurity expert.
Networking skills, Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit, Ness,Monitoring,Ettercap, Vega , Maltego , Burp suite ,Beef &Guy whom you always want to get knowledge from 

Post my graduation was a completely different ball game. I had wholly devoted myself to scoping out prospective intern positions in the computer security industry in India. Well as it goes, 'Lo and beholds,' my first internship as a penetration tester at ENCIPHERS. Under the tutelage of Abhinav Mishra(ex. UHG, HCL), I began creating real-time vulnerability reports, solve bug bounty programs, and achieve the much-needed experience to ascend the rungs in the career ladder. My next stint was at Great Learning. I created and worked on the Standford Computer Security program, which was supported and delivered by Great Learning. I even managed and provided technical supports for a group of 30 students including global students.

I believe that a person's life could influence the lives of an incredible number of people for the better or worse, and my bet is on the former.
