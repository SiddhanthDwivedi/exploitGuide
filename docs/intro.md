Introduction to Vulnearbility Assessment and Penetration Testing
-------------------------------------------------------------------

What does this VAPT stands for :
V --> Vulnerability : The LOOPHOLES ,security misconfigurations which 		can cause an attacker to get inside a network or website or in 		  other terms the ways which help an attacker to intrude in the 	  systems.
A --> Assessment : It simply mean that analyzing the vulnerability and 		 scanning the vulnerability onto how much it could cause damage 	  to the victim.
P --> Penetration : When you get the vulnerability and is accessed, a 		report is generated and through that further exploitation or 		  intrusion is done this is known as penetrtion .
T --> Testing : When a person is penetrating it requires several 		  procedures or attacks to penetrate this is done thrugh this  		  testing phase. 


Most of the scenario this whole process is carried out in two parts 
VA and PT

VA : Scanning of loopholes and weak security points. In this phase we just scan for the devices, web application, server, network, website and database.We don't penetrate in this phase.

PT : To gain access into the scanned vulnerabilities. We just try to hack into the services, devices, web application, servers and databases via the scanned vulnerabilities.s
